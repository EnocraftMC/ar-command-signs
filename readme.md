Command Signs
=======
----------
Description :
-------------
This plugin offers to admins the possibility to create Command signs, button or plates.
When players interact with one of these blocks, they will run the commands on the block.

Admins also have the possibility to provide temporary permissions to players.
E.g : if your players do not have the warp permission but you want them to be able to */warp arena* by a command sign, you could add the temporary permissions :
*essentials.warp*
*essentials.warps.arena*

You can also set needed permission for the command block to be usable.
E.g : If you want only VIP people to go into a specific area, you could add the needed permission
*server.permissions.vip*

Commands :
----------
    /commandsign help
